# EDGE_AI_GAMEBOT_WRKSHP2
Overview
Welcome to the AI Bot Workshop! In this workshop, we'll explore the fascinating world of artificial intelligence (AI) and create a chatbot using simple programming techniques. By the end of this session, you'll understand the basic principles behind AI bots and have hands-on experience coding a chatbot from scratch.

Workshop Goals
Introduce participants to the concept of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Guide participants through creating a basic AI bot using Python.
Provide insights into how natural language processing (NLP) works.
Enable participants to interact with their AI bot and extend its functionality.
Requirements
Before starting the workshop, please make sure you have the following:

Python installed on your computer (version 3.7+).
Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).
Basic knowledge of Python programming (variables, functions, loops, etc.).
Internet access to download necessary libraries.
Recommended Libraries:
nltk for natural language processing
chatterbot for creating the chatbot model
Flask or Tkinter for adding a user interface (optional)
To install the necessary libraries, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install nltk chatterbot flask
Workshop Outline

What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Overview of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
How chatbots are used in real-world applications.
2. Setting Up the Development Environment
Installing Python and libraries.
Setting up Jupyter Notebook or a preferred IDE.
3. Creating a Simple Chatbot
Understanding how chatbots "learn."
Building a basic chatbot using the ChatterBot library.
Training the bot with sample conversations.
4. Improving the AI Bot
Adding more complex features like sentiment analysis.
Implementing a user interface with Flask or Tkinter (optional).
5. Testing and Interacting with the Bot
Testing the chatbot's responses.
Engaging in a conversation with the bot and analyzing its answers.
6. Extending the Bot’s Capabilities
Adding custom responses.
Training the bot with more data to improve its accuracy.
Getting Started
Clone or download the workshop code from the repository.
Open the Python files or Jupyter Notebooks provided.
Follow along with the instructions in the notebook.
Feel free to make changes to the bot’s responses, and try adding more data to train the bot.
